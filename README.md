# Invite
You can [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=773839407596961803&permissions=8&scope=bot) the bot, but because this project has been abandoned by the original author, it'll never come back online. I advise you to self-host your own instance if you really want to use it.

### Info for Pull Requests:
* You can always create one and if I think thats better then my code, I would put it in the source code and might put the Discord name of the user in special thanks that created the request.

If you have any questions about the bots code, just DM makus#1414 on Discord.
